--> Dependency Injection
• Dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on, called dependencies. 
• Typically, the receiving object is called a client and the passed-in ('injected') object is called a service. The code that passes the service to 
the client is called the injector. The 'injection' refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the client that uses it.
• Code is cleaner with the DI principle and decoupling is more effective when objects are provided with their dependencies. 

Example of Greeting Service App : 
• Greeting Service has some dependencies like EnglishGreetingService,FrenchGreetingService etc.
• Instead of you, manually build the dependencies, Spring bean factory will do that work for you (developer)
• Spring bean factory will give you objects of the dependencies, ready to use!
• Now, we will also provide daily fortunes to people in their own language
- New helper: FortuneService
- This is a dependency of GreetingService

● In Spring, you can perform Dependency Injectionin three ways:
1) Constructor injection
2) Setter or Method injection
3) Field or Property injection

--> Constructor Injection : 
• Constructor Based Dependency Injection is the one in which the wiring between beans is achieved using constructors. 
• When such a dependency injection is performed, the container invokes a constructor with one or more arguments, each representing a dependency.
• In this we can inject :-
i. Dependency object (contained object)
ii. Primitive and String-based values

• Constructor Injection - Process : 
1) Define the dependency interface and class
example : 
       // helper service
       public interface FortuneService(){
           public String getFortune();
       }
       //dependency
       public class EnglishFortuneService implements FortuneService{
           public String getFortune(){
            return "abc";
           }
       }

2) Create a constructor in your class for injections
example : 
         //dependency
       public class EnglishFortuneService implements FortuneService{
          // Helper Service
           private FortuneService fortuneService;
           //Constructor
           public EnglishFortuneService(FortuneService fortuneService){
            this.fortuneService=fortuneService;
           }
           public String getFortune(){
            return "abc";
           }
       }
       
3) Configure the dependency injection in Spring config file (applicationContext.XML)
example :
        <bean id="engGreeting" class="com.ncu.GreetingApp.EnglishGreeting_Service">
        <constructor-arg ref="engFortune"></constructor-arg>
        </bean>

        <bean id="engFortune" class="com.ncu.GreetingApp.English_Fortune">
        </bean>

• In your main class – request the Greeting Service bean from Spring container and invoke greet() and getDailyFortune().   
example : public class App {
    public static void main( String[] args ){
    	// --> SPRING CODE - Dependency Injection
    	
    	// Step 1 : Initialize the Spring Container
    	ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
    			
    	// Step 2 : Get the Desired Bean
    	Greeting_Service service=context.getBean("spanishGreeting",Greeting_Service.class);
    	
    	// Step 3 : perform the desired operation
    	service.greet("SANYAM");
    	
    	System.out.println(service.getDFortune());
    	
    	// Step 4: Close 
    	context.close();
    }
}     

--> Setter Injection : 
• Setter based dependency injection is one of the ways spring allows to do DI.
• As setters let us update object properties after its creation, this behavior is a perfect candidate to add optional dependencies in a Spring IoC container.
• Setter injection is done by injecting dependencies into the setter methods of your class 
• Setter injection plays an alternative when constructor injection is not required or not possible
• For instance, satisfying all dependencies at the constructor will slow down the application. But if we could initialize the required dependencies, setters will help to inject optional dependencies. 

• Setter Injection - Process
1. Create Setter method(s) in your class for injections
example : 
         // creating setter method for injection
         public void setForService(FortuneService fortuneService){
            this.fortuneService=fortuneService;
         }
     
2. Configure the dependency injection in Spring config file.
example : 
        <bean id="engGreeting" class="com.ncu.GreetingApp.EnglishGreeting_Service">
        <property name="ForService" ref="engFortune"></property>
        </bean>

        <bean id="engFortune" class="com.ncu.GreetingApp.English_Fortune">
        </bean>


--> Field or Property Injection :  
• In this type of Dependency Injection, Spring assigns the dependencies directly to the class fields.
• The interesting thing to understand is, Spring injects the dependencies, even if the field is private. 
• Spring uses Java Reflections to do so. Hence it is called unsafe by many of the experts.  

• Field Injection - Process :
1. Declare fields in your class
  // classFields
  private String name;
  private String addresss;

2. Create getters and setters in your class 
  public void setName(String name){
    this.name=name;
  }
  public void setaddress(String address){
    this.address=address;
  }
• Setters for injection & Getters for fetching the values

3. Configure the injection in Spring config file
<bean id="myspa" class="org.ncu.Spanish">
<property name="name" value="sanyam"></property>
<property name="address" value="sbc"></property>
</bean>

--> Injecting values using Property File
• Follow the steps below:
1. Create Properties file – field.properties
name=sanyam
address=abc

2. Load properties file in Spring config file
<context:property-placeholder loction="classpth:filed.properties"/>

3. Reference values from Properties file
<bean id="myspa" class="org.ncu.Spanish">
<property name="name" value="${name}"></property>
<property name="address" value="${address}"></property>
</bean>
